/* HW 14.12.2020
1. write all numbers from -1000 to +1000 using do-while loop
2. read oreh,rohav,hekef from user until the hekef was 2*oreh+2*rohav using do-while loop
   for exmaple:
   oreh=3, rohav=4, hekef=12 is wrong, since 3*2 + 4*2 = 14... so the user should input the numbers again
   oreh=1, rohav=5, hekef=12 is correct since 1*2 + 5*2 = 12... so the loop should end after this input
3. now solve targil 1,2 to using while(true)+break loop 
4. read temperature from user (float)
   if temperature < 35 print "out-of-range" + break 
   if temperature > 42 print "out-of-range" + break
   if temperature > 37.5 and temperature <= 42 print "sick"
   if temperature > 35 and temperature <= 37.5 print "healthy"
   use while (true) + break
